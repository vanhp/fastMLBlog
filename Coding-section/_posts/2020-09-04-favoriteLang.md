## The would be choice of mine


### <span style="color:green">In the beginning</span>

I have been writting code for a while now that I don't have enough fingers to count the years.
I have used and continue to use these languages since most of the time it dictate by the task and the environment it in. I definite have a favorite one, on the other hand it's not that important since I rarely have to dicide. 

Task to do would lead you to choose the language for example. When I decide to write and Android App it' been decide which language to choose it going to be either Java or Kotlin this is because Android framework and ecosystem support these two, further more, in the working environment your colleague and company which refine your choice. If they more experience or comfort level in one of these languages.

However, If write this app on my personal time I use Kotlin since is newer and have less wart and annoying work around than Java. It integrate quite seemlessly functional contstruct and exciting new feature such as Asynchronous programming and it's the future of Android development.

As any shiny new object it does have sharp edge and dark corner one have to be aware of.


### <span style="color:coral"> Kotlin Vs Java battle of the isle</span>

Both Kotlin and Jave name after patch of land that surround by the sea. Maybe the author of the language feel a little notstalgic when move to the main land.

#### <span style="color:orange">Java</span>

Java the old king.
It's design to be simple language with simpler set of rule calls syntax. It an Object Oriented paradyme language. It wordship the Object as the deitry beall and endall every thing and only thing in it is Object.
You start out writing class and class and class and some more class since only class will set you free at least in Java world view. It also have comarade in war call C# which at war in the early day of C# (C# is copy-cat of Java create by Microsoft as competitor to Java which create by Sun at the time).

 The most annoying feature of this is that it force user to repeat the code over.






#### <span style="color:orange">Kotlin</span>

The new comer

Kotlin remove majority of the paint point of Java and add some nicety of modern tech such as Asynchonous programming, type inference and functional construct. It also make threading concurrency programming a little easier to swallow. You don't have to jump through loop of fire, and burn mid-night oil to get you paralell code to work correctly.
