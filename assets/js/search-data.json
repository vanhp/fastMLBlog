Can I see the result of my editing on my local machine directly without push it to github first? . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. . Example 1: DropDown . # single-value selection over [Major_Genre, MPAA_Rating] pairs # use specific hard-wired values as the initial selected values selection = alt.selection_single( name=&#39;Select&#39;, fields=[&#39;Major_Genre&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;], init={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: &#39;Drama&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: &#39;R&#39;}, bind={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: alt.binding_select(options=genres), &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: alt.binding_radio(options=mpaa)} ) # scatter plot, modify opacity based on selection alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( selection ).encode( x=&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;, y=&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, tooltip=&#39;Title:N&#39;, opacity=alt.condition(selection, alt.value(0.75), alt.value(0.05)) ) .

            "title": "Activationfunctions",
            "content": "Activation functions provide non-linearity to the system and act like a switch to the system. . Activation functions are classified into single kink and double kinks on their graph. The shape of the kink e.g. smooth vs hard kink is depend on scaling value equivalence hard kink does not change scaling factor, while the smooth kink will change the the output value scaling factor . Hard kink vs Soft kink it matter of scaling equivalent . Hard kink it provide scaling of output . when the input multiply by a scalar value the output also have the effect with multiply by same scalar . Soft Kink it change the behavior of output . When the input value e.g. multiply by 100 the output look like it have hard kink . When divide the input with the same value the output look smooth . Activation that have single kink in the graph . which does not change signal only the scale . Rectilinear Unit (ReLU) . There are multiple variation of ReLU activation functions . ReLU(x) = (x)+ = max(0,x) has 0 at bottom and sharp kink for all positive value . | Leaky ReLU (x) = {x if x ≥ 0, negative slope of x otherwise . | . Allow bottom (horizontal asymptote) to have negative value so there still chance to have gradient . PReLU (x) {x, if x ≥ 0 , ax otherwise a = alpha is a leakable parameter . | . The value does not change other than the scale of value a, which different input units . Value alpha may be fixed or learned. It can have different values or a may be shared with different units. A value may not have to be learn but preset to ensure the gradient value is non zero . SoftPlus(x) = 1/beta * log(1 + exp(beta* x)) . | . A smooth approximation of ReLU can be used to constrain the output to always be positive where the beta get large it closer to ReLU . RReLU(x) = {x if x≥ 0, ax otherwise randomize leaky ReLU the same as leaky ReLU . | ELU(x) = max(0,x) + min(0,a * (exp(x) - 1) a softer version of ReLU by adding a small constant to smoothing it. And the bottom(horizontal asymptote) can be negative it allow for system to have average output value to be 0 which is useful for certain situation which have both positive and negative value which allow for faster convergent . | CELU(x) = max(0,x) + min(0,a * (exp(x/a) - 1) have the same effect as ELU . | GELU(x) = x * phi(x) where phi(x) is the cumulative distribution function for Gaussian Distribution . | ReLU6(x) = min(max(0,x),6) has two kink point on the graph at 0 and at saturation point at 6 . | . Activation that have 2 kink in the graphs . Double kink has built in scale where input signal is very different from output signal . Sigmoid(x) = sigma(x) = 1/1+exp(-x) has smooth curve for value between 0 and 1 problem with gradient go to 0 fairly quickly as it get closer to asymptote so the weight of the unit become too large which saturate the unit so the gradient drop fast the learning is not efficient. Sigmoid doesn’t work well when the value normalizes (with batch/group norm) just before it. Since normalization fix the scaling make the mean 0 and variance constance so the system doesn’t depend on the weight but the system now loss the ability to choose with kink to use in the 2 kink like sigmoid . | tanh(x) = tanh(x) = exp(x) - exp(-x)/exp(x) + exp(-x) has graph that identical to sigmoid except it center at 0 and go from -1 to 1 has the output to be closer to 0 mean but not 0 which allow the weight value after it to see both + and - which converge faster. Unfortunately, for deep stacking layers they are not learning efficiently and must be careful in normalizing the value. Which is why the single kink function tend to do better with deep layer network . | Softsign(x) = x/1+ | x | similar to sigmoid except it doesn’t get to the asymptote as fast and doesn’t get stuck toward asymptote as quickly as sigmoid | . | HardTanh(x) = {1 if x ≥ 1, -1 if x ≤ -1,x otherwise the linear region range is -1,1. It has a sharp kink both at negative value at bottom and positive value at top. Work fairly well for small network where the weight is not saturate too much . | . Use in sparse coding . rarely use in neural network . Threshold y = { x, if x threshold, value otherwise . | . rarely use since gradient can not propagate through it . Tanhshrink(x) = x - tanh(x) use mostly on sparse coding to shrinking the latent variable . | softShrinkate(x) = { x - lambda, if x &gt; lambda, x+ lambda, if x &lt; -lambda, 0 otherwise it has sharp kink at both bottom and top of graph . | HardShrink(x) = {x - lambda, if x &gt; lambda, x+ lambda, if x &lt; -lambda, 0 otherwise where value between -lambda and +lambda are set to 0 . | LogSigmoid(x) = log(1/1+exp(-x)) mostly use for loss function instead . | softmin(xi) = exp(-xi)/sum(exp(-xj)) when apply to input Tensor it rescaling the element of vector to the range of [0,1] which the sum to 1 similar to softmax with minus sign in front xi value . | Softmax(xi) = exp(xi)/sum(exp(xj)) same with softmin . | . Temperature is redundant with incoming weight (beta value) matter when the input size is fixed due to normalization. It uses to control how hard(the different between large and small value in the output vector) the distribution of the output value will be it the system to make hard decision even though it doesn’t learn as well as before. It used in case of mixture of expert system when multiple subnetwork output are linear combine with coefficients from the output of the softmax which may be controlled by another NN with soft mixture with low beta then gradually increase to infinity the will force NN to choose one and ignore the rest this may safe compute time (call annealing) . LogSoftmax(xi) = log(exp(xi)/sum(exp(xj))) use at the output as part of the loss function . | .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. . Example 1: DropDown . # single-value selection over [Major_Genre, MPAA_Rating] pairs # use specific hard-wired values as the initial selected values selection = alt.selection_single( name=&#39;Select&#39;, fields=[&#39;Major_Genre&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;], init={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: &#39;Drama&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: &#39;R&#39;}, bind={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: alt.binding_select(options=genres), &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: alt.binding_radio(options=mpaa)} ) # scatter plot, modify opacity based on selection alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( selection ).encode( x=&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;, y=&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, tooltip=&#39;Title:N&#39;, opacity=alt.condition(selection, alt.value(0.75), alt.value(0.05)) ) .
