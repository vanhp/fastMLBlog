## <span style="color:green">Here are some of the useful sites that I have come across:</span>

#### <span style="color:coral"> AI/ML field</span>
[Jeremy Howard](https://www.fast.ai/) He is one of the expert in the AI/ML field. The greating about it is that he give all of this execllent material for free. If you want to learn about AI/ML here is the place to start. And his fastai library which current reach version 2 is the state-of-art in the field that is rapidly moving. And ofcourse, fastpages the library this site is used the testament to his brilliant.

[Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) The founder of Coursera and the pre-eminent current AI expert. You can some of his material on Youtube and on Coursera.

[Yann Lecun](http://yann.lecun.com/) The Turing Award winner and some calls him the father of modern AI/ML. You can find his lecture of Youtube especially on current hot topic in self-supervise learning.

#### <span style="color:orange"> Software development field </span>

[Douglas Schmidt](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/) is one of prolific professor of computer science. He has ton of contents about sofware and especially in C++ and Java, Android. This is where I come when I feel a little rusty on C++ and Java. His material are up up to date and top-notch.
